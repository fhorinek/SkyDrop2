<p><strong>Change widgets</strong> selection allow to assign different widget options on current home screen. Use arrow buttons to scroll between fields on the screen, use middle button to select field for widget change, which will be chosen from widget list in next step. Several widgets are adjustable (e.g. altimeter widgets <strong>Alt</strong>) or can enable/disable specific function can be toggled (e.g. <strong>beep</strong> or <strong>weak</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>You can chose from following widgets:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vario bar</strong> shown graphically value of analog vario, each step represents 1m/s. The vario bar increases from middle to top when vario shows 0 to 3 m/s, then decreases from middle to top when vario shows 3 to 6 m/s.

<h2 id="description-of-menu-functions">description of menu functions</h2>
<p>The menu is accessible by long pressing the middle button and the select the right menu entry with the right button. Here is a description of the available menu entries.</p>
<h3 id="vario">Vario</h3>
<p><strong>Lift/Sink threshold</strong> defines the vertical speed value when sound is activated (in 0.1m/s steps).</p>
<p><strong>Weak lift</strong> enables continuous sound before lift threshold is reached to let pilot know “something is in the air” (in 0.1m/s steps). Frequency will change linearly from low to high inside weak range.</p>
<p><strong>Fluid audio</strong> allows sound tone change during actual beep.</p>
<p><strong>Digital vario int.</strong> suppress very fast vario changes and makes displayed digital vario value more stable in 0.1s steps (won't affect vario bar graph or sound output).</p>
<p><strong>Average vario int.</strong> defines time used to compute average vario value, used for overall thermal power overview (in 0.1s steps).</p>
<p><strong>Units</strong> can by metric or imperial (meters or feets per second).</p>
<p><strong>Use accel</strong> checkbox allow barometer and motion sensors (9D IMU) signal fusion to accelerate vario response to small quick altitude changes.</p>
<p><strong>Vario demo</strong> can simulate device behavior to achieve desired settings (in 0.1m/s steps). Frequency, length and pause of beep is displayed.</p>
<h3 id="altimeters">Altimeters</h3>
<p><strong>Mode</strong> can by absolute related to QNH1 or QNH2, relative to other altimeter (with offset adjustable though home screen widget), or following GPS altitude.</p>
<p><strong>Zero at takeoff</strong> checkbox only in altimeter relative mode set altimeter value to zero right after takeoff (automatic or manual).</p>
<p><strong>Units</strong> can by metric or imperial (meters or feets).</p>
<p><strong>Get from GPS</strong> set altimeter value equal to actual GPS value. Then is works independently from GPS. If in QNH dependent mode, this choice will change also QNH value. In relative mode QNH value stays, just offset is changed. <strong>Note</strong> : Altimeter value is based on atmospheric pressure, which varies during weather changes, therefore altimeter should be calibrated prior to takeoff. Altimeter calibrating can be done by entering the known altitude of location or setting the known QNH value valid for current area or get from stabilized GPS value (GPS altitude is changing slower within fast altitude changes, so it can take some time for stabilization, usually several minutes). If HAGL data is available it is preferred over GPS height value as long as you are on ground.</p>
<p><strong>Alarms</strong> Allows you to set various alarms, that will be triggered when the entered height is reached. There is a LOW, LOWEST and HIGH alarm. Lower alarms will be raised when the height of the pilot is lower than the entered value, which is typically used by acro pilots. For high alarms the height must be higher, which can be used if you fly inside restricted areas near airports. The reset value is the distance to the alarm limit, where the alarm will stop.</p>
<h3 id="logger">Logger</h3>
<p><strong>Enabled</strong> checkbox enables or disables GPS tracking.</p>
<p><strong>Total time</strong></p>
<p><strong>Format</strong> of output file can be chosen IGC, KML or RAW.</p>

Long press of middle button when <strong>FTime</strong> widget is highlighted is used to manual start/stop flight time stopwatch. <strong>Suppress audio</strong> checkbox mutes the device when waiting for takeoff, so launch area is not saturated by random mix of annoying sounds generated by many waiting varios.</p>
<p><strong>Record always</strong> checkbox disables automatic start/stop of logging. Logger will start recording when device is turned on until it is turned off.</p>
<p><strong>Pilot name, Glider type</strong> and <strong>Glider id</strong> fields are used to be written in recorded track log.</p>
<h3 id="flight-logs">Flight logs</h3>
<p>contains all recorded logs showing basic flight statistics.</p>
<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>
<p>There are two different kinds of navigation: HOME and WAYPOINT.</p>

<p><strong>Enabled</strong> checkbox enables/disables bluetooth function (using this function significant for battery power).</p>
<p><strong>Protocol</strong> selection changes devices communication between protocols (apps) - DigiFly (XCSoar), LK8EX1 (XCtrack), BlueFly (FlyMe) or SkyBean. <strong>SkyDrop SPP</strong> Bluetooth device must be chosen when pairing with your phone or tablet.</p>
<p><strong>Forward GPS</strong> checkbox will enable forwarding GPS coordinates to connected device, so there is possibility to turn off its internal GPS receiver to save power.</p>
<h3 id="settings">Settings</h3>
<p><strong>Time</strong> item in settings menu allow adjust on-board clock.</p>
<p><strong>Date</strong> item in settings menu allow adjust on-board date.</p>
<p><strong>Time zone</strong> entry is useful with GMT time obtained from GPS receiver to set correct local time.</p>
<p><strong>DST</strong> checkbox means daylight saving time option if applicable.</p>
<p><strong>Sync with GPS</strong> checkbox allows to get accurate time from GPS.</p>
<p><strong>Display contrast</strong> adjustment tunes LCD screen contrast.</p>
