Subject: Using True Type Font: Thin Pixel-7 version 1.0

Hello!

I am contributing to https://github.com/fhorinek/SkyDrop, an open source
software for a vario, which is a small device used by paraglider pilots. =
The
software is provided for free and I want to use your font "Thin Pixel-7
version 1.0" in it. Do you give me permission to do that? This would =
also
mean, that we upload your font to github and we will make sure, that =
your
readme and all other files are also there. Is this enough or do you want =
us
anything else to do?

Thanks!

Kind regards
