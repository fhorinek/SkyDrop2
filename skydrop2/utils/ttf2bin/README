This is to create binary fonts for SkyDrop.

USAGE
=====

Execute "python convert.py" to read various ttf files from directory
source and create the corresponding "*.h" header files containing the
fonts. These header files must be copied to src/data and will then be
used during compilation of the firmware.

CORRECTION
==========

For some fonts and characters, the generated pixels are not
optimal. You can correct them manually and use these human corrected
characters during the above USAGE.

During execution, the directory "tmp" will contain single PNG files
for each font, size and character. Choose the file, which you would
like to optimize and copy it to the directory "corrected". Use a pixel
painting program (like GIMP) to correct the character images.

The convert.py will look for character files in "corrected" and use
them instead of the automatic generated images. This allows to
override the automatic generation and use better version from you.
